# NUMS Game Specification

## Game Overview

NUMS is a probabilistic number placement game where players attempt to place 20 randomly drawn numbers (from 1-1000) into 20 sequential slots while maintaining strict ascending order.

## Core Mechanics

### Game Flow
1. Player pays **2000 NUMS** tokens to enter
2. System randomly draws 20 unique numbers from range [1, 1000]
3. Numbers are presented one at a time
4. Player must place each number into an available slot
5. Once placed, numbers cannot be moved
6. All placed numbers must maintain strict ascending order (slot[i] < slot[i+1])

### Win Conditions
- **Primary Win**: Successfully fill all 20 slots in ascending order
- **Partial Success**: Earn placement rewards based on number of slots filled

### Loss Condition
- Game ends when a drawn number cannot be legally placed (no valid slot maintains ascending order)

## Probability Distribution

Based on empirical data from 284,029 games:

### Key Statistics
- **Expected Slots Filled**: 9.88 slots
- **Median Performance**: 10 slots
- **Mode**: 10 slots (most common outcome)
- **Standard Deviation**: 3.37 slots

## Tokenomics Model

### Entry Fee Distribution
**Total Entry**: 2000 NUMS tokens

#### Pool Allocation
- **50%** (1000 NUMS) → Placement Rewards Pool
- **50%** (1000 NUMS) → Jackpot Pool

### Placement Rewards

Players earn NUMS tokens proportional to their slot filling performance:

#### Reward Formula
For each filled slot `i`:
```
reward_per_slot = i × base_multiplier
base_multiplier = 18.66 NUMS
```

Total reward for `n` filled slots:
```
total_reward = Σ(i × base_multiplier) for i=1 to n
             = base_multiplier × n × (n+1) / 2
```

#### Expected Payouts by Performance

| Slots Filled | Placement Reward | Net Result | Occurrence Rate |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 19 NUMS | -1981 NUMS | 0.49% |
| 2 | 56 NUMS | -1944 NUMS | 1.10% |
| 3 | 112 NUMS | -1888 NUMS | 2.13% |
| 4 | 187 NUMS | -1813 NUMS | 3.55% |
| 5 | 280 NUMS | -1720 NUMS | 5.24% |
| 6 | 392 NUMS | -1608 NUMS | 7.26% |
| 7 | 522 NUMS | -1478 NUMS | 9.05% |
| 8 | 671 NUMS | -1329 NUMS | 10.58% |

| 13 | 1699 NUMS | -301 NUMS | 7.15% |
| 14 | 1961 NUMS | -39 NUMS | 4.91% |
| 15 | 2239 NUMS | +239 NUMS | 2.88% |
| 16 | 2538 NUMS | +538 NUMS | 1.45% |
| 17 | 2855 NUMS | +855 NUMS | 0.61% |
| 18 | 3191 NUMS | +1191 NUMS | 0.18% |
| 19 | 3545 NUMS | +1545 NUMS | 0.04% |
| 20 | 3918 NUMS | +1918 NUMS | 0.002% |

**Average Placement Reward**: 1000.0 NUMS (perfectly sustainable)

### Jackpot Pool

The jackpot pool accumulates 1000 NUMS per game and distributes to top performers.

#### Distribution Rules
1. **Progressive Jackpot**: Accumulates until won
2. **Winner Threshold**: Players filling 18+ slots share current jackpot
3. **Distribution Split** (when multiple winners in same period):
   - 20 slots: 60% of jackpot
   - 19 slots: 30% of jackpot
   - 18 slots: 10% of jackpot

#### Expected Jackpot Accumulation
- **Games between 18+ slot fills**: ~439 games
- **Average jackpot at trigger**: ~439,000 NUMS
- **Expected value per game**: 1.14 NUMS

### Sustainability Analysis

#### Revenue Model
Per game income: 2000 NUMS

#### Expense Model
- Placement rewards: 1000.0 NUMS (average)
- Jackpot contribution: 1000 NUMS
- **Total expenses**: 2000.0 NUMS

#### Sustainability Metrics
- **House Edge**: 0.00% (perfectly balanced)
- **Base multiplier**: 18.66 NUMS ensures exact sustainability
- **Long-term sustainability**: Guaranteed with 50/50 split between placement and jackpot pools

## Implementation Requirements

### Smart Contract Functions
1. `enterGame(uint256 entryFee)` - Process entry and fee distribution
2. `drawNumber()` - Generate random number [1, 1000]
3. `placeNumber(uint8 slot)` - Validate and place number
4. `calculateRewards()` - Compute placement rewards
5. `distributeJackpot()` - Handle jackpot distribution

### Random Number Generation
- Use verifiable random function (VRF) for fairness
- Ensure numbers are unique within each game
- Range: [1, 1000] inclusive

### State Management
- Track current game state per player
- Maintain jackpot pool balance
- Record historical performance for statistics

## Game Variants (Optional)

### Difficulty Modes
1. **Easy**: 15 slots, range [1, 500]
2. **Normal**: 20 slots, range [1, 1000] (default)
3. **Hard**: 25 slots, range [1, 1500]

### Tournament Mode
- Fixed entry period
- Top 10% of players share prize pool
- Ranked by slots filled + tiebreaker (completion time)

## Security Considerations

1. **Anti-Gaming Measures**
   - Prevent number prediction
   - Rate limiting per address
   - Minimum block confirmations for RNG

2. **Economic Security**
   - Reserve fund for jackpot guarantees
   - Maximum jackpot caps
   - Automated rebalancing mechanisms

## Conclusion

The NUMS game provides a challenging, mathematically fair gaming experience with sustainable tokenomics. The 2000 NUMS entry fee is redistributed entirely to players through placement rewards (50%) and jackpot pools (50%), ensuring long-term viability while maintaining excitement through rare but substantial wins.
